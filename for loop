Loops:
       Loops is used to execute the code in several times.
For loop.
        Syntax:
                for(initilization;condition;increment(or)dicriment){}
Example:
    for(let i=0;i<10;i++){
        document.write(i,"<br>")
      }
         Output:
 0
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
Example:
 for(let i=3;i<=9;i=i+2){
        document.write(i+3,"<br>")
      }
Output:
Initially it is 3 then coming to the print statement 3+3=6
Next it will be incriment to 3+2=5.next conidition will checks 5<=9 . Then after it will going to print the 5+3=8.
Next it will be incriment to 5+2=.7next conidition will checks 7<=9 . Then after it will going to print the 7+3=10.
Next it will be incriment to 7+2=9.next conidition will checks 9<=9 . Then after it will going to print the 9+3=12.
Next it will be incriment to 9+2=11.next conidition will checks 11<=9.The above condition is false.Now loop is terminating.
Output:
6
8
10
12
